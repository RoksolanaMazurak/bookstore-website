      "Physics genius Caro Kerber-Murphy knows she’s smart. With straight As and a college scholarship already in the bag, \
			she’s meeting her two dads’ colossal expectations and then some. But there’s one test she’s never quite been able to ace: love. \
			And when, in a particularly desperate moment, Caro discovers a (definitely questionable) scientific breakthrough that promises to \
			make you irresistible to everyone around you, she wonders if this could be the key. What happens next will change everything Caro \
			thought she knew about chemistry – in the lab and in love. Is hot guy Haruki with her of his own free will? Are her feelings for her \
			best friend some sort of side-effect? Will her dog, Sirius, ever stop humping her leg?",
